Sometimes people ask me if 4 years ago, when I started this project,
I expected **BehaviorTree.CPP** to gain so much adoption in the robotic community.
Even if that is generally meant as a rhetorical question that expects and humble answer,
I usually answer "yes". 


There are few reasons why I was optimistic about the fact that this
library might be well received:

- It helps implementing a crucial component of a robotic software system,
Task Planning; this part is often neglected until the end of the project.

- I spent an unusual amount of time (may be 30% of my whole development time)
writing documentation.

- I wanted to build an inclusive project, where people needs and opinions are heard.
I am still a "benevolent dictator", but I **do** listen and I **do** learn from others!

## Growth in recent years

**BT.CPP** is gaining traction in robotics, as shown in the image
below (note that the Y-axis is logarithmic):

This data was obtained from the paper:

 [Behavior Trees and State Machines in Robotics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04211)

SMACH is certainly an early adopter and it is still the strongest contender,
but you can also note as BT.CPP and PyTrees are gained more
an more popularity in the community.

Please refer to the publication mentioned above to
learn more about the methodology used to obtain
these numbers and to compare the frameworks.

## Documentation is a super power

You might be familiar with the phrase:

>"[If a tree falls in a forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)
and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

My personal take on this is:

> If an open source software is not used by other people but the author, is it still "good" software?

In both cases, we know that the answer is (or might be) **"yes"**, but hopefully you see where this is going.

Very often, open source is about "scratching your own hitch" and share what you did with others. That is fine!

But in my case, I created this project **specifically to help others**; the more it is adopted and used, the more
I feel like my initial goal has been achieved.

In my career, I learn that the best way to drive adoption is:

- built something that people need.
- build trust with your users.
- lower as much as possible the entry barrier.

The latter point is particularly important and it is often underestimated. 
For me, lowering the entry barrier involved three key steps:

- writing good documentation (this website).
- adding tutorials whcih give the new usuers a sense of progression.
- providing a tool that help people learn visually (Groot).

The documentation of **BT.CPP** is not perfect, but probably a little above the average from what you
would expect from an open source project: this costed a lot of time, but paid off enormously.
