## Why do we need a C++ Behavior Tree library?

In the robotic community, we have a couple of some examples of State Machines libraries:

- [Smach](http://wiki.ros.org/smach)
- [FlexBe](https://github.com/FlexBE)
- [SMACC](https://github.com/reelrbtx/SMACC)

And another implementation of Behavior Trees:

- [PyTrees](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees)

All of these projects, *with the exceptions of SMACC*, have something in 
common: they are implemented with **Python**.

This makes sense a lot of sense: task planning usually benefits from the flexibility and high
level abstraction of a scripting language, and doesn't require low latency.

Nevertheless, C++ is the most common language used by roboticists;
this is the reason why I wanted to implement a library specifically focused on C++.

With **BT.CPP**, we have the flexibility of a scripting language, with the power of C++.
